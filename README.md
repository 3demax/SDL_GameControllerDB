# SDL_GameControllerDB

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/p-groarke/SDL_GameControllerDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/p-groarke/SDL_GameControllerDB)

A community source database of game controller mappings to be used with SDL2 Game Controller functionality.

## Releases

### [2.0.5](https://github.com/p-groarke/SDL_GameControllerDB/releases/tag/2.0.5)
For games or engines using the SDL 2.0.5 format. There are no range or inversion modifiers (+,-,~). It contains 282 controller entries, with duplicates removed.

### [2.0.4](https://github.com/p-groarke/SDL_GameControllerDB/releases/tag/2.0.4)
For engines or games using the SDL 2.0.4 format. GUIDs are different depending on the platform. It contains 237 controller entries, with duplicates removed.

## Creating new mappings
### [SDL2 Gamepad Tool](http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)
This seems to be the easiest and most reliable way to configure your gamepad. It is cross-platform (Windows, macOS and Linux).

Setup your controller and copy the ouput entry. The tool currently doesn't output SDL 2.0.5 GUIDs, but that is fine as SDL still supports these GUIDs. I will convert older GUIDs in pull requests as well.

### Steam
In Steam's Big Picture mode, configure your joystick. Then look in `[steam_installation_directory]/config/config.vdf` in your Steam installation directory for the `SDL_GamepadBind` entry. It is one of the last entries, it will look something like this.

```
"SDL_GamepadBind"		"030000004c050000c405000000010000,PS4 Controller,a:b1,b:b2,back:b8,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,guide:b12,leftshoulder:b4,leftstick:b10,lefttrigger:a3,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightshoulder:b5,rightstick:b11,righttrigger:a4,rightx:a2,righty:a5,start:b9,x:b0,y:b3,"
```

Unfortunately, *Steam doesn't ouput the platform field*, so you will need to add it manually. At the end of the generated entry, add "platform:Windows," or "platform:Mac OS X," or "platform:Linux,".

### SDL2 ControllerMap
You can also use the controllermap utility provided with SDL2.

## Usage
Download gamecontrollerdb.txt, place it in your app's directory and load with:

```
SDL_GameControllerAddMappingsFromFile("gamecontrollerdb.txt");
```

# For Contributors

## Checking your mappings
Before submitting a new Pull Request, please run the `check.py` tool to make sure everything is in order. It requires python3 installed. Run it with:
```
python3 check.py gamecontrollerdb.txt
```

If no errors were generated you can (please) send a Pull Request! Tests are automatically run on Pull Requests, so you'll easily see if there is an issue.

### New Checks
- Tests are run to ensure a platform is present.
- Tests are run to make sure inversion and range modifiers are applied to axis fields.
- Tests are run to check duplicates.

### Options
```
usage: check.py [-h] [--sort] [--convert_guids] [--remove_dupes]
                [--add_missing_platform]
                input_file

positional arguments:
  input_file            database file to check (gamecontrollerdb.txt)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --sort                sort the database on success
  --convert_guids       convert Windows and macOS GUIDs to the newer SDL 2.0.5
                        format
  --remove_dupes        automatically remove duplicates
  --add_missing_platform
                        adds a platform field if it is missing (on older pre
                        2.0.5 entries). Skips checks!
